  <h1>JLogic</h1>
  
  <p>
  JLogic is a tool for creating functions and programs using a graphic interface instead of writing code in a programming language (this is called "visual scripting").

  With JLogic you can visually edit, test and deploy functional graphs, called "blueprints", and use them as RESTful APIs or batch scripts.
